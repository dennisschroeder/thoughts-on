 # Programming language shaming
 
 I assume everybody in our buisness came across a tweet or a blogpost where they passionatly argued about whether programming language a ist better than
 b and why the other is poorly designed (like Php when you ask me)!
 
 And even though I admit that I find them pretty entertaining every once in a while I also think that this
 is the reason we as an industry haven't moved much in the past decades. One will argue "but we have react and vueJs, angular
 kubernetes, docker, kafka, cassandra and so on". Yes we habe those tools and I will not smaller theire value.
 I am glad they exist, but I don't think theire impact on the industry is significant.
 
 Compare the tools mentioned above with the invention of version control systems, especially git and services like
 GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket , etc. The foundation of our daily base work was founded on these tools, Open Source Software.
 
 But if tools are not important, what is? What are the challenges we have to face as an industry?
 
 ... coming soon!
