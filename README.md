# Thoughts on ...
Here I share my mental model of software development and related stuff. To avoid any misinterpretations. The content shown here is only my opinion based on my experiences as a software engineer and my interpretations of knowledge I gained through readings, videos and attending talks at conferences that I find to be logically true or helpful. I do not claim that what I write is always the truth. Instead, if you find any of my content discussable, please feel free to contact me by opening an issue, sending me an email or hitting me up on one of my channels.
